# License FAQ <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

### What licenses do you use for your products?

Our protocols are released as open source with a permissive license ([MIT](docs/mit.md)), enabling anyone to review the code and make modifications with minimal restrictions.

Our applications, on the other hand, are distributed under [a source available license](docs/asal.md). While anyone can review and modify the code, certain Commercial uses are not allowed. Please see the license for details. If you wish to engage in Commercial uses that are not allowed, you would need a separate license from us.

Documentation and translations created by Any's team or contributors are in the public domain.

As for use cases, integrations, and themes in our applications created to share through the marketplace, the choice of a license will be left up to their creators. 

### What does ‚Äúsource available license‚Äù mean?

Source available license allows anyone to review and modify the code, but certain Commercial uses are not licensed. If you need additional rights, please [contact us](mailto:license@any.coop).

### What is ‚ÄúNon-Commercial‚Äù use? 

Our source available license allows ‚ÄúNon-Commercial Use,‚Äù which means personal, academic, scientific, or research and development use, or evaluating the Software, but does not include uses where the Software facilitates any transaction of economic value other than on Allowed Networks. Please see [the license](docs/asal.md) for details.

### Why have you decided to use the source available license?

We believe that this approach will promote transparency and freedom for the community, while also enabling contributors to create a sustainable ecosystem around our code.

### Can I contribute to the source code of your products?

Yes, but after signing [the CLA](docs/cla.md).

### Can I fork your products and use it to launch a paid alternative?

Possibly, but you need to contact us first and discuss the conditions of adding your networks in the list of Allowed Networks. This would be a Commercial use that will require obtaining a separate use grant from us.

### Can I use your applications to access the networks not affiliated with Any Association?

You can do it if this network is listed as an Allowed Network; otherwise it is not allowed under our source available license. If you need additional rights, please [contact us](mailto:license@any.coop).

### Can I use the text of your license in my projects?

Yes, anyone can adopt the text of this license, and we hope that many organizations and individuals will use it to protect themselves, their communities, and their intellectual property. Just don‚Äôt forget to replace the name of organization üôÇ

### Can I use Anytype inside my company?

Yes, of course, commercial use is permitted in Allowed networks.

### Can I self-host Anytype within my company?

If you use Anytype internally in your company without requiring any transactions of economic value (e.g. subscriptions, membership fees, or staking tokens), then it complies with the license terms. However, if transactions of economic value occur, you need to obtain a specific permission or license. Please [contact us](mailto:license@any.coop) to discuss this.

### Why didn't you do it differently, when clients are open source and protocols are source-available?

Indeed, there are projects which call themselves open source, but which open source only their clients and keep their protocols and backends closed. We don't see this approach as fully transparent, as users can't validate what happens with their data under the hood. 

We also aim to provide users with full control of their data, and open-sourcing the data protocol and infrastructure layer enables this opportunity fully. 

The [source-available license](docs/asal.md) which we chose for the client applications also provides full transparency about how this software works, and allows users to modify it and contribute to its development. At the same time, it provides protection for the creators, both core team and contributors, of this software from abuse. 

Therefore, we consider this approach to be the best possible for both users and creators.

### Did a lawyer check this license?

We took the task of creating a license that reflects our [Open Philosophy](https://blog.anytype.io/our-open-philosophy/) seriously. 

To craft the right license, we worked with [Heather Meeker](https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/), a lawyer renowned for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as aiding numerous organizations in creating licenses similar in spirit to the ELv2, SSPL, and others.

### Why didn‚Äôt you choose AGPL instead of creating a new license?

As an open source license, the AGPL doesn't allow any restrictions on Commercial use of the software, leaving the space open for abuse by competitors and not providing protection for the contributors of the software we are seeking.

### Will Anytype apps be licensed under Any Source Available License forever?

The Any Association, based in Zug, Switzerland, is an organization that governs the rights to use the software and will provide an opportunity for other significant contributors to join a sort of digital cooperative and become the governors of the software as well.

At the point when the product becomes sustainable, Any Association, including significant contributors, will review the governance principles and consider changing the license to open source.

### Is Anytype project open source?

Anytype is open-code: protocols and infrastructure are open-source, and clients are source-available. Source-available licenses allow anyone to review and modify the code, but certain commercial uses are not allowed. This type of licenses is not OSI-approved, so, with full respect to the open-source community, it is not correct to call the entire project open-source from the open-source definition perspective.

### Who can I ask questions about the Any Source Available License?

We're fully open for discussion and will be happy to answer your questions and update this FAQ. Please contact us via [license@any.coop](mailto:license@any.coop).
